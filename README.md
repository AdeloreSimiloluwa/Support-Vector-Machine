# Support-Vector-Machine
Support vector classification with python.

What this algorithm does is to find the line that best maximizes the margin between the support vectors from the classes in the data.

A company sent out email offers which invite customers to take an action or not (purchase or not). In the dataset, we have certain information about the customers, their gender, age, estimated salary and if they took an action or not.

You are to classify each of those customers based on the action and predict if a customer would to take an action or not based on their age and estimated salary.

###### Predict
Imagine a customer who is female and 35 years old who earns 100,000 USD. Would she take an action or not? How confident are you in your prediction?
